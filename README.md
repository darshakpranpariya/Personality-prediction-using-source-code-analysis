# Personality-prediction-using-source-code-analysis
----------------------------------------------------
This is a small project which is created using KNN algorithm of scikit learn machine learning library. 
This is predict the personality(level) of the programmer using his hand written source code....
This project is not so much accurate but i created this project as a beginner of learning ML. 

->This project is done by html,css,php and python so first you should put all the file into your local server folder except user1.sql.
  (WAMP->www folder,XAMPP->htdocs folder).
->then put user1.sql into the sql server and run it...so sql table will created in your sql database for login or signup perpose.
->then run your local server and first run home1.php file into the browser...
->one problem is occure in this project is you need to run python file separately......
->one thing you should consider is, put your code into the p1.txt file for analysis......
->thank you....
